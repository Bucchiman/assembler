# Lesson 4
## Subroutines
- They are reusable pieces of code that can be called by your program to perform various repeatable tasks.
- They are decleared using labels just like we've used before(e.g. \_start)
- You don't use the JMP instruction, but use the Call
- You don't use the JMP instruction to return to our program after wwe have run the function
- You can use the RET to return your program
